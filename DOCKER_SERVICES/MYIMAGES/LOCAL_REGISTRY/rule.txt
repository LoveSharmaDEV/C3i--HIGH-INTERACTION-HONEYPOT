Deploying Local Registry !!!!

Aim: Deploying local registry in Master Node. So that all the images can be locally pulled and saved from the slave node.

Envirnment: Performing it in three noded cluster

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. This is my /etc/hosts file for all Master and slave nodes

127.0.0.1	localhost
192.168.99.1    kubemaster
192.168.99.2    kubeslave1
192.168.99.3    kubeslave3
# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters

Make sure you have the same kind of configuration in your 3 noded architecture
ARCHITECTURE
kubemaster 
kubeslave1
kubeslave2

All the three nodes should be able to ping each other which is an obvious condition in forming noded architecture.


2. Now build and run the docker-compose file. This would intiate a docker registry in your system at port 5000.

3. Stop it for now as we have to perform certain configurations

4. Now there have to certain configurations done in all the nodes(master and slave)

got to /etc/docker/daemon.json if not already there create it

And edit it as follows:
{
	"insecure-registries": ["kubemaster:5000"]
}

Here kubemaster is my master node IP
Copy exactly the same content in slave nodes also

5. Once the daemon.json is set,  restart the docker service (systemctl restart docker)

6. Now the docker registry is set and running for use

7. Now to work with this local docker registry

In master node:

docker pull <image_name>:<tag>   (This will pull image from docker hub)
docker tag <image_name>:<tag> kubemaster:5000/<image_name:tag>
docker push kubemaster:5000/<image_name:tag>

In slave node:

docker pull kubemaster:5000/<image_name:tag>
